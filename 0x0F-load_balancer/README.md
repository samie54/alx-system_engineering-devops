Project Tasks:

0. Double the number of webservers
mandatory
In this first task you need to configure web-02 to be identical to web-01. Fortunately, you built a Bash script during your web server project, and they’ll now come in handy to easily configure web-02. Remember, always try to automate your work!

1. Install your load balancer
mandatory
Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.

Requirements:

Configure HAproxy so that it send traffic to web-01 and web-02
Distribute requests using a roundrobin algorithm
Make sure that HAproxy can be managed via an init script.

2. Add a custom HTTP header with Puppet
#advanced
Just as in task #0, we’d like you to automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet.

The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
