Project Tasks:

0. World wide web
mandatory
Configure your domain zone so that the subdomain www points to your load-balancer IP (lb-01). Let’s also add other subdomains to make our life easier, and write a Bash script that will display information about subdomains.

1. HAproxy SSL termination
mandatory
“Terminating SSL on HAproxy” means that HAproxy is configured to handle encrypted traffic, unencrypt it and pass it on to its destination.

Create a certificate using certbot and configure HAproxy to accept encrypted traffic for your subdomain www..

2. No loophole in your website traffic
#advanced
A good habit is to enforce HTTPS traffic so that no unencrypted traffic is possible. Configure HAproxy to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
